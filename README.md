## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project's core speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities are powered by the incredible open-source project [Unmute](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/unmute) by Kyutai Labs. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/knyl2013/ielts-examiner-gateway.git
    cd ielts-examiner-gateway
    ```

2.  **Create a local environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file. This file will hold your secret keys and configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment variables:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your project credentials and any other required API endpoints.
    
    The only required env variables for running the project are: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` for any OpenAI-compatible model (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) to analyze the conversation and estimate IELTS score after the conversation is finsihed.

4. **Launch unmute AI**
    Go to https://github.com/kyutai-labs/unmute and startup unmute using docker-compose. Make sure http://localhost:8000 is accessible before moving on to the next step. 

5.  **Run the start script:**
    This script will automatically install all necessary dependencies and launch the development server.
    ```bash
    bash start.sh
    ```

You should now be able to view the application at `http://localhost:3000`
