## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/knyl2013/ielts-examiner-gateway.git --recurse-submodules
    cd ielts-examiner-gateway
    ```

2.  **Create a local environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file. This file will hold your secret keys and configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment variables:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in your project credentials and any other required API endpoints.
    
    The only required env variables for running the project are: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` for any OpenAI-compatible model (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama) to analyze the conversation and estimate IELTS score after the conversation is finsihed.

4. **Launch unmute AI**
    Copy the environment file and docker-compose file to unmute project after filling the necessary variables
    ```bash
    cp .env unmute/.env
    ```

    Install and setup NVDIA container tookit
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
    sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```

    Start up the unmute project
    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory ./unmute -f ./docker-compose-unmute.yaml up -d --build
    ```

    Stop the unmute project
    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory ./unmute down
    ```

5.  **Run the start script:**
    This script will automatically install all necessary dependencies and launch the development server.
    ```bash
    bash start.sh
    ```

You should now be able to view the application at `http://localhost:3000`
